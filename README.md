screeps-starter-python
==========

This repository is a starter Python AI written for the JavaScript based MMO game, [screeps](https://screeps.com).

While code uploaded to the server must be in JavaScript, this repository is written in Python. We use the
[Transcrypt](https://github.com/QQuick/Transcrypt) transpiler to transpile the python programming into JavaScript.

This repository is intended as a base to be used for building more complex AIs, and has all the tooling needed to
transpile Python into JavaScript set up.
